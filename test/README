This directory contains test suites for the package. All test programs are
named in "text_xxx" pattern. Normally this directory is not built. If you want
to build these test programs, just type `make unittest' at the top source tree.
You need to install the unit test lib of boost (www.boost.org) before building
these programs.

A python script `runall.py' is provided, which will run all available tests
and report the result.
